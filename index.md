## Core principles 

- Onen, Stevens, and Collins 2011
  - Programs should teach core principles, not specific tools 
  - Game industry is driven by technological innovation  
  
<!-- 
- Programs should teach core principles, not specific tools 
  - This is because technology changes rapidly in game audio field  
  - Curriculum should focus on adaptability and autonomous learning 
- Game industry is driven by technological innovation  
  - Software and tech can become outdated quickly
  - Students need early understanding of different areas 

 -->

---

## Soft skills

- Industry emphasizes technical skills and "soft skills" (Onen, Stevens, and Collins 2011; Bragança 2015)
- Recommend recreating industry pressures to nurture soft skills (Bragança 2015)

<!-- 

- Industry emphasizes the need not only for technical skills, but also for "soft skills" like communication and teamwork.
  - These soft skills are often overlooked in academia but critical for industry with its needs of collaboration. 
- Braganca recommend recreating industry pressures in class to nurture soft skills

-->

---

## Curricula 

- Core Courses
  - Core courses develop skills like recording, editing, programming (Onen, Stevens, and Collins 2011; Sarisky and Pennycook 2009)
  - Common first year allows understanding other areas (Onen, Stevens, and Collins 2011) 
- Specialized tracks
  - Tracks in areas like composition, sound design, audio programming (Sarisky and Pennycook 2009)
- Curriculum should foster teamwork on collaborative projects (Onen, Stevens, and Collins 2011)

<!-- 
The literature offers suggestions for building a multi year game audio curriculum with common courses and specialized tracks. At DSU we offer core courses that are geared generally to music technology and we offer only one game audio course, but this concept is still helpful. 

- Onen, Stevens, and Collins suggest core courses to build essential skills like recording and programming, and a common first year offers a broad foundation. Sarisky and Pennycook follow this by suggesting specialized courses offer depth in areas like composition and sound design, aligning with career goals. All agree that curriculum should emphasize teamwork through collaborative projects, preparing students for the interdisciplinary nature of the field.
 -->

# Weeks 7 - 12: Audio Implementation and Wwise 

- **Middleware Choices**: Wwise or FMOD
- **Initial Setup**: Unity and Wwise Integration
- **Advanced Techniques**: Sound Positioning & Triggering

![bg right:50%](images/wwise.webp)

<!-- 
- Middleware is the software that allows sound designers to place sounds in a game. Its like the DAW of the game audio world.  
- We use Audiokinetic Wwise as our middleware, but FMOD is another popular choice. The depth of audio implementation covered in class should depend on students' technical ability and interest.
- Week 7 focuses on setting up Unity (a common game engine) and Wwise for game audio. It covers the installation process, user interface exploration, and a foundational project that involves simple spatial audio techniques.
- As we progress through weeks 11-12, we introduce more complex topics like sound positioning, triggering sounds through player actions, and creating a footstep system using random containers and switches.
 -->

# <!-- fit --> Possible curriculum updates

- Reduce time on game audio history
- Focus more on game music composition
- Streamline audio implementation setup
- Refine final project guidelines

<!-- 
- I've found that spending three weeks on the history of game audio is excessive and takes away from practical application. In future iterations, I'll cut this down to allocate more time for composing and implementing game music.
- Another area I intend to improve is the audio implementation setup. I've noticed that many students face roadblocks here, mostly due to unclear instructions for installing the necessary software. To address this, I plan to provide more explicit and simplified guidelines to ensure that we spend more time learning about game audio implementation and less time troubleshooting.
- Finally, I'm looking to make the final project more effective as a learning experience. I aim to make the project description less open-ended and provide a curated list of games for sound implementation. This will help students focus on delivering higher quality work.
