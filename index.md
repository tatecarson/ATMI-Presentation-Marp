## Curriculum Standards

- No established curriculum or standards for game audio education (Onen et al. 2011; Bragança 2015; Cunningham and Smith 2015; Sarisky 2011; Hug 2007)
- Programs vary considerably between institutions 
- More work needed on dedicated programs meeting industry needs (Onen et al. 2011)

<!-- 

**No established curriculum or standards**

- There is currently no established curriculum or set of standards for comprehensive game audio education programs (Onen et al. 2011; Bragança 2015; Cunningham and Smith 2015; Sarisky 2011; Hug 2007). 
- Different academic institutions vary considerably in their game audio offerings, leading to gaps and inconsistencies in students' knowledge.
- More work is needed to develop dedicated programs meeting industry needs (Onen et al. 2011).
 -->


---

## Gaps and inconsistencies  

- Gaps and inconsistencies in game audio education (Onen et al. 2011; Bragança 2015; Cunningham and Smith 2015; Sarisky 2011)
- No formal worldwide curriculum exists (Bragança 2015) 
- Students encounter inconsistencies integrating game audio (Cunningham and Smith 2015)
- Audio neglected compared to visual development (Sarisky 2011)
- No established curriculum allows iterative teaching approach (Hug 2007)

<!-- 

**Gaps and inconsistencies**

- Onen et al. (2011) argue significant gaps exist in game audio education, with few options for comprehensive knowledge.
- Bragança (2015) states no formal worldwide curriculum exists for game audio. More awareness needed to implement it successfully.
- Cunningham and Smith (2015) note students encounter inconsistencies integrating game audio into broader degree programs in the UK.
- Sarisky (2011) points out audio is often neglected compared to visual game development. 
- Hug (2007) sees it as an advantage there is no established curriculum yet, allowing an iterative teaching approach.

## Interdisciplinary  

> Game audio is highly interdisciplinary, spanning multiple academic disciplines.  


<!-- 
Here are short descriptions of how each source discussed the interdisciplinary nature of game audio:

Onen et al. (2011):

- Game audio creators fall between arts/humanities and computer science programs in most schools. 
- Field encompasses many academic departments while requiring specialized knowledge like programming.
- Points out challenges incorporating knowledge from so many disciplines.

Game Audio Curriculum Guideline (2011):

- Notes game audio combines disciplines often separated in universities.
- Practitioners wear many hats, blurring lines between roles.  

Bragança (2015):

- Emphasizes game audio's interdisciplinary nature demands awareness of diverse topics.
- Calls for collaboration between academic departments.

Sarisky and Pennycook (2009):

- Proposed an interdisciplinary degree program.
- Addresses needs for composers and audio engineers in industry.

## Core principles 


  - Programs should teach core principles, not specific tools 
    - Technology changes rapidly in game audio field  
    - Focus on adaptability and autonomous learning 
  - Game industry driven by technological innovation  
    - Software and tech can become outdated quickly
    - Students need early understanding of different areas

## Soft skills

- Industry emphasizes technical skills and "soft skills" (Onen et al. 2011; Bragança 2015)
  - Soft skills overlooked in academia but critical for industry (Bragança 2015)
  - Soft skills key for an industry based on collaboration (Bragança 2015)
  - Soft skills like communication and teamwork (Onen et al. 2011)
- Recommend recreating industry pressures to nurture soft skills (Bragança 2015)
- Adaptability also important (Onen et al. 2011) 

<!-- footer:  '' -->

---

## Curricula 

- Core Courses
  - Core courses develop skills like recording, editing, programming (Onen et al. 2011)
  - Sample curricula have common core and specialized tracks (Sarisky and Pennycook 2009; Onen et al. 2011) 
  - Common first year allows understanding other areas (Onen et al. 2011) 
- Specialized tracks
  - Suggested courses cover recording, editing, mixing, synthesis, etc. (Sarisky and Pennycook 2009)
  - Tracks in areas like composition, sound design, audio programming (Sarisky and Pennycook 2009)
- Curriculum should foster teamwork on collaborative projects (Onen et al. 2011)

---

## Project-based learning

- Experiential, project-based learning encouraged (Onen et al. 2011; Hug 2007)
  - Develops portfolio work and collaboration skills
  - Recommends learning cycles with simulation, role play (Onen et al. 2011)
  - Courses join sound design, modeling, programming in collaborative projects (Hug 2007)
- Team projects allow reflecting on roles, developing capabilities (Onen et al. 2011) 
- Ongoing journaling and portfolio development suggested (Onen et al. 2011)

---


## Industry Feedback 

- Ongoing feedback from industry and updating curricula is important as game audio practices evolve 
- More pedagogical materials need to be developed to support teaching

- Sarisky Course
  - Introduction to the Concepts of Audio for Electronic Games

<!-- footer: '' -->

<!-- 
- The game audio curriculum guidelines suggest an entire course on game audio history: 
  - Summary: The course "Video Game and Game Audio History (X-02)" provides an overview of the history of video games, focusing on the evolution of sound and music. Teaching methods include lectures, discussions, and projects, covering topics from the history of video games to the impact of technology on audio. Evaluation is based on participation, a mid-term exam, presentations, and a final project.
- Sariksy's course implements a history module within a larger course
  - Sarisky's course, "Introduction to the Concepts of Audio for Electronic Games," focuses on sound design in gaming, covering terminology, technology, and techniques for implementing sound and music. The course explores the history of game audio, principles of sound implementation, and introduces various middleware tools like Xact, Wwise, Fmod, and Unreal. Upon completion, students will be equipped to analyze sound designs, understand the roles in an audio production team, and apply sound assets using level editing tools.
