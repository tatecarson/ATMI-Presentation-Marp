### Speaker Notes

- I've found that spending three weeks on the history of game audio is excessive and takes away from practical application. In future iterations, I'll cut this down to allocate more time for composing and implementing game music.
- Another area I intend to improve is the audio implementation setup. I've noticed that many students face roadblocks here, mostly due to unclear instructions for installing the necessary software. To address this, I plan to provide more explicit and simplified guidelines to ensure that we spend more time learning about game audio implementation and less time troubleshooting.
- Finally, I'm looking to make the final project more effective as a learning experience. I aim to make the project description less open-ended and provide a curated list of games for sound implementation. This will help students focus on delivering higher quality work.
