# Advice from the literature

<!-- footer: '' -->

## Curriculum Standards

- No established curriculum or standards for game audio education (Onen et al. 2011; Bragança 2015; Cunningham and Smith 2015; Sarisky 2011; Hug 2007)
- Programs vary considerably between institutions 
- More work needed on dedicated programs meeting industry needs (Onen et al. 2011)

<!-- 

**No established curriculum or standards**

- There is currently no established curriculum or set of standards for comprehensive game audio education programs (Onen et al. 2011; Bragança 2015; Cunningham and Smith 2015; Sarisky 2011; Hug 2007). 
- Different academic institutions vary considerably in their game audio offerings, leading to gaps and inconsistencies in students' knowledge.
- More work is needed to develop dedicated programs meeting industry needs (Onen et al. 2011).
 -->


---

## Gaps and inconsistencies  

- Gaps and inconsistencies in game audio education (Onen et al. 2011; Bragança 2015; Cunningham and Smith 2015; Sarisky 2011)
- No formal worldwide curriculum exists (Bragança 2015) 
- Students encounter inconsistencies integrating game audio (Cunningham and Smith 2015)
- Audio neglected compared to visual development (Sarisky 2011)
- No established curriculum allows iterative teaching approach (Hug 2007)

<!-- 

**Gaps and inconsistencies**

- Onen et al. (2011) argue significant gaps exist in game audio education, with few options for comprehensive knowledge.
- Bragança (2015) states no formal worldwide curriculum exists for game audio. More awareness needed to implement it successfully.
- Cunningham and Smith (2015) note students encounter inconsistencies integrating game audio into broader degree programs in the UK.
- Sarisky (2011) points out audio is often neglected compared to visual game development. 
- Hug (2007) sees it as an advantage there is no established curriculum yet, allowing an iterative teaching approach.

## Interdisciplinary  

> Game audio is highly interdisciplinary, spanning multiple academic disciplines.  


<!-- 
Here are short descriptions of how each source discussed the interdisciplinary nature of game audio:

Onen et al. (2011):

- Game audio creators fall between arts/humanities and computer science programs in most schools. 
- Field encompasses many academic departments while requiring specialized knowledge like programming.
- Points out challenges incorporating knowledge from so many disciplines.

Game Audio Curriculum Guideline (2011):

- Notes game audio combines disciplines often separated in universities.
- Practitioners wear many hats, blurring lines between roles.  

Bragança (2015):

- Emphasizes game audio's interdisciplinary nature demands awareness of diverse topics.
- Calls for collaboration between academic departments.

Sarisky and Pennycook (2009):

- Proposed an interdisciplinary degree program.
- Addresses needs for composers and audio engineers in industry.

Bragança 2015; Sarisky and Pennycook 2009).**' -->

## Core principles 


  - Programs should teach core principles, not specific tools 
    - Technology changes rapidly in game audio field  
    - Focus on adaptability and autonomous learning 
  - Game industry driven by technological innovation  
    - Software and tech can become outdated quickly
    - Students need early understanding of different areas

## Soft skills

- Industry emphasizes technical skills and "soft skills" (Onen et al. 2011; Bragança 2015)
  - Soft skills overlooked in academia but critical for industry (Bragança 2015)
  - Soft skills key for an industry based on collaboration (Bragança 2015)
  - Soft skills like communication and teamwork (Onen et al. 2011)
- Recommend recreating industry pressures to nurture soft skills (Bragança 2015)
- Adaptability also important (Onen et al. 2011) 

<!-- footer:  '' -->

## Curricula 

- Core Courses
  - Core courses develop skills like recording, editing, programming (Onen et al. 2011)
  - Sample curricula have common core and specialized tracks (Sarisky and Pennycook 2009; Onen et al. 2011) 
  - Common first year allows understanding other areas (Onen et al. 2011) 
- Specialized tracks
  - Suggested courses cover recording, editing, mixing, synthesis, etc. (Sarisky and Pennycook 2009)
  - Tracks in areas like composition, sound design, audio programming (Sarisky and Pennycook 2009)
- Curriculum should foster teamwork on collaborative projects (Onen et al. 2011)

---

## Project-based learning

- Experiential, project-based learning encouraged (Onen et al. 2011; Hug 2007)
  - Develops portfolio work and collaboration skills
  - Recommends learning cycles with simulation, role play (Onen et al. 2011)
  - Courses join sound design, modeling, programming in collaborative projects (Hug 2007)
- Team projects allow reflecting on roles, developing capabilities (Onen et al. 2011) 
- Ongoing journaling and portfolio development suggested (Onen et al. 2011)

---


## Industry Feedback 

- Ongoing feedback from industry and updating curricula is important as game audio practices evolve 
- More pedagogical materials need to be developed to support teaching
